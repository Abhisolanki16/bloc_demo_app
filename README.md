# 🧩 Flutter BLoC & Cubit Demo Apps

This repository contains two simple Flutter demo applications that showcase effective state management using the [`flutter_bloc`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) package.

## 📱 Overview

- ✅ **To-Do App (Cubit):**  
  A lightweight task manager built using **Cubit**, demonstrating minimal and straightforward state handling.

- 👤 **Person Manager App (BLoC):**  
  A basic CRUD (Create, Read, Delete) app using the full **BLoC pattern** that allows users to add and remove persons along with their name and date of birth.

These examples help you understand the differences between **Cubit** and **BLoC**, making it easier to choose the right approach for your Flutter projects.
